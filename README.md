# Portfolio HTML Template

I originally built this for my technical writing portfolio, but I've decided to offer it as a forkable/downloadable template.

This is a simple, responsive html template for portfolios that can be adapted for multiple uses. Portfolios that are image-heavy (photography, art, etc.) should probably look for a different template. This template will not focus on your artwork enough.

## Features

* Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
* 22 different watercolor painting banner graphics to choose from.
* Comes with a [default favicon](https://pixabay.com/vectors/flat-design-symbol-icon-www-2126884/) and [portfolio item thumbnail graphics](https://pixabay.com/collections/file-format-set-5790206/). 

## Prerequisites

* Some level of HTML knowledge would be best (if you don't have any, don't worry, it's not that hard to learn)
* Github account *or* your own webhosting
* A text editor like Visual Studio Code
* An image editor if you want to create your own graphics (thumbnails, banners, etc.)

## How to Use

There's two main ways you can use this template:

1. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/): The simplest way to get started on your online portfolio is to fork this repository and then rename it to username.github.io. More detailed instructions are included in the user guide. (Sorry, still working on that.)

2. Other Hosting: Download the latest release, edit it as needed, and then upload it to your hosting. (This is vastly simplified, but I'm assuming you know what you're doing if you're already paying for webhosting.)

## Documentation

I'm working on a user guide for this as a side project.
